# Basic Node and Express

This is the boilerplate code for the Basic Node and Express Challenges. Instructions for working on these challenges start at [FreeCodeCamp Backend Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/basic-node-and-express/meet-the-node-console).

## Notes

- During the development process, it is important to be able to check whatâ€™s going on in your code.
- Node is just a **JavaScript environment**. Like client side JavaScript, you can use the console to display useful debug information. On your local machine, you would see console output in a terminal. By reading the output in the terminal, you can see any errors that may occur. The server must be restarted after making changes to its files.

---

### Debugging with Console

- **Node outputs console logs** to the terminal.
- Check for **errors in the terminal** after making code changes.

---

### Restarting the Server

- Use **`Ctrl + C`** to stop the server.
- Restart the server with either:
  - `node mainEntryFile.js`
  - `npm run` (if you have a script in `package.json`).

---

### Auto-Restarting on Save

- Add `"start": "node --watch server.js"` to your `package.json`.
- Or install **`nodemon`** for automatic restarts.

---

### Start a working express server

---

- The Express app object has several methods, one fundamental method is the `app.listen(port)`.
- Use `app.listen(port)` to tell your server to listen on a given port and put the server in a running state.
- For testing reasons, this method has been added to the `server.js` file already.
- Routes follow this structure: `app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)`, where:
  - `METHOD`: The HTTP method (e.g., `GET`, `POST`).
  - `PATH`: A relative path (e.g., `/` for the root).
  - `HANDLER`: A function called when the route is matched.
- Handlers take the form `function(req, res) {...}`, where `req` is the request object, and `res` is the response object. In the example of a handler below, the handler will serve the string 'Response String'.

```js
function(req, res) {
  res.send('Response String');
}
```

---

### Serve an HTML file

---

- Express allows you to respond to requests with a file using the `res.sendFile(path)` method. This method can be put inside the `app.get('/', ...)` route handler.

#### How It Works

1. Behind the scenes, `res.sendFile(path)`:

   - Sets the appropriate headers to instruct your browser on how to handle the file you want to send, according to its type.
   - Then it will read and send the file to the client as a response.

2. **Absolute File Path Requirement**:
   - This method needs an absolute file path to locate the file.
   - It is recommended you to use the Node global variable `__dirname` to calculate the correct file path relative to the project directory like this:

```js
absolutePath = __dirname + "/relativePath/file.ext";
```

**Note**: `res.sendFile()` requires an absolute path to locate the file. Using `__dirname` ensures the file path is correct relative to your project directory.
